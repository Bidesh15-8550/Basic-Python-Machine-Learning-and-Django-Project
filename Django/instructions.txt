First go to terminal and install in venv- pip install django

to create a new project- django-admin startproject pyshop .
						(project name)

to run server- python manage.py runserver


to create other sections- python manage.py startapp products(It will create a folder namaed products)

__init__ if contain in any folder its a package


I have to go to settings inside the pyshop and add the class for which i want to make a database

to make migrations- python manage.py makemigrations (to create the migrate)

now use - python manage.py migrate (to migrate)

now drag and drop in sqlite to see the database

if i goto the server and use /admin then it will reditect to admin page, its created by default

##to create superuser type- python manage.py createsuperuser (by giving username,email and pass)

to add more columns in admin panel go to the folder and admin file of which u want to add.
Like- there are group and user in admin panel and you want to add product. So go to product folder and edit admin.py
then write this codes,   from django.contrib import admin
			 from .models import Product

			 admin.site.register(Product)
